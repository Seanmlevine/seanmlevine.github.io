<h1>Interview with Yanchao Liu<h1> 


<h3>Yanchao Liu is currently a Digital Signal Processing Engineer at Shure Inc. in Chicago. Yanchao originates from Beijing, China where he received his Bachelors of Engineering in Recording Arts Technology/Technician at the Communication University of China. He transitioned his academic focus when he came to Georgia Tech to receive his Master of Science in Music Technology. For his research, he worked in the Music Informatics Lab under Professor Alexander Lerch. Since many of his interests at Georgia Tech stemmed in Electrical Engineering he also received his Master of Science in Electrical and Computing Engineering, specializing in Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning. Before his work began at Shure, he Interned for Gracenote and Bose Corporation. Both of these internships were focused on audio research and audio processing.

<h4>What is your position/job title and what are your key roles and responsibilities at Shure?</h4>

<p>My job title is DSP Engineer and my key role is developing DSP algorithms and maintaining support for other project teams that interface with existing DSP algorithms.</p>

What lead you to become a DSP engineer and what classes have been useful for this career?

It was 4-5 years ago when I was an Audio Engineer during my undergraduate degree. I was doing a lot of recording and professional audio in the industry so at that time I decided to join the company that developed the music equipment. That’s why I joined the Music Technology degree at Georgia Tech and then I decided to finish my Master’s in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech as well. I took a lot of classes in the ECE department and many of them are DSP-focused. Many of the DSP jobs require computer architecture skills so I also took some C++ programming and classes along those lines. When I was interning with Bose, I was looking at jobs that focused on audio rather than a company with a niche audio department. Shure came on my radar, I interviewed with them and I have been here ever since. 

Why did you choose to find a job at a company that was focused on audio?


Even back when I was in my undergrad, I chose to be an Audio Engineer because I love music. I went through all my work in programming and hardware design with the desire to find a better sound. All this hard work was backed by my passion for music, so I don’t believe I would have the passion to be a pure Software Engineer for a website or company related to music. When I don’t have a passion, I don’t perform the best.

What kind of skills help you the most in your work?

For my company, MATLAB scripting and sometimes python is widely used in Machine Learning development.  C++ is the requirement for all development engineers. I learned how to work with Embedded Systems after I started working at Shure and it seems as though it is a really big deal for any company working with hardware especially when you are a DSP engineer. The basic analysis and understanding of audio such as comprehension of waveforms and audio processing make a difference in how the company selects its workers. It is rare to have a Software Engineer or Electrical Engineer with an audio-based background. If you have a background in audio with the technical skills of an Electrical Engineer that makes a big difference during the interview process. 

When working with Embedded Systems, what resources do you find useful to be knowledgeable about?

Mostly we are using ARM architecture, I do not develop Embedded System code, but we assist the Embedded Systems team with DSP algorithms. My team has to be knowledgeable about how to work with an Open-Source operating system to do testing. Linux is commonly used and if you are a Linux master, you will have a great leg-up. Working with Linux can be a difficult task if you are used to operating systems such as Mac or Windows. A lot of the work that comes with Linux is learning how to use the command line and interfacing with computer architecture. 

What are some of the challenges you encountered during your first few years working for Shure?

This is common for starting a job in research. When you step into a new area that you have not worked in previously, there is so much to learn, so many unexpected problems, and so many aspects of scheduling that you have to adapt to. Researching new topics can be frustrating because you look into a new concept, try to apply it and it does not go as you would expect. This separation between concepts and applications will give you a delay on projects and cause you to worry. Working at a company like Shure can be quite different research at an institute. Since Shure is focused on creating products, having the information and knowledge that you obtain to write a paper is not enough of a deliverable. Companies like this will tend to expect your work to assist or create a finished product.  Other than that, work has been great and very manageable.

What is a common workday/week for you?

I have a meeting with my manager once a week, two to three meetings with senior engineers, and one team meeting once a week. There is on average, one meeting a day.  I spend half the time doing my research topic for development. This involves writing MATLAB code, reading research papers, making tools, researching old tools, asking how others made their tools, and documentation. The other half of the development is working with other teams and delivering DSP algorithms for them. This is where deadlines become more strict and the deliverables become more defined. Despite all of these responsibilities, there is plenty of time to learn about new research topics on your own time and I have been using my time learning about beam-forming. There are plenty of ways to access code from other workers and papers to learn about concepts that you think will be useful to your work in the future. 

How much flexibility do you have working for Shure?

Shure lets you go to the office when you want, so I go into the office three times a week. Many choose to work entirely from home and some who choose to come into the office every day. There is plenty of time at lunch to grab food and talk to people. Every time that you see someone on the team is free, you can reach out and talk with them about their work and projects. We base our project timelines on quarters. So we create deadlines and goals that we aim to reach within each quarter.

What is the atmosphere at Shure?

People here are very friendly and have a passion for music. We plan many music events where people at the company can create their own bands and show their music skills. Many of the people at Shure are older with kids in comparison to companies like Google. It is much more chill than other technology companies. People are welcome to crack jokes and take their own time on projects. 

What do you recommend a prospective DSP engineer learn or do before interviewing for jobs?

Having a lot of projects related to creating a DSP algorithm or incorporating a DSP into a project will be a big help for an interview. Having a background in Machine Learning will be useful because many new companies are aiming to incorporate it into their products. DSP theory, low-level programming, Machine Learning theories, and Embedded Systems would all be applicable.  

How do you apply Machine Learning to your work?

There are teams such as the Data Analysis teams that focus on creating and implementing Machine Learning algorithms into their work. For the DSP team, you have to at least understand the concepts and how to integrate their algorithm into the product. We focus on deploying the Machine Learning algorithm into Embedded Systems. The DSP team aims to optimize the algorithm for the memory and processing limits of the respective chips and devices. 


How do you like living in Chicago?

I like it a lot! It reminds me of a colder Atlanta. The city is walkable there is Lake Michigan nearby and many things to do. I would say that the people in Atlanta are much more friendly than Chicago. The living expenses are very reasonable compared to San Francisco Bay Area. I had a sailing class over the summer which I highly recommend. 

Yanchao is currently living in the greater Chicago area following his passions of running, music production, and cooking. His transition into his work as a DSP engineer at Shure has been a great experience with few complaints. Shure is filled with passionate people that are friendly and share his love for music. For those that are looking into a DSP engineering job, Yanchao highly recommends learning about DSP fundamentals, low-level coding, Machine Learning algorithms, and Embedded Systems.
